# The Journey

**Date**: November 2025  
**Status**: Beginning

## Philosophy: Don't Panic

This repository represents a systematic approach to learning systems engineering. Instead of scattered projects and fragmented knowledge, everything is organized, documented, and interconnected.

## The Questions

Key questions this journey seeks to answer:

- How do embedded Linux systems actually work?
- What happens during the build process?
- How do you debug kernel-level issues?
- How do you create custom Linux distributions?
- How do you automate infrastructure?

The answers come through hands-on experimentation and documentation.

## Hardware Platforms

Available hardware platforms:
- Raspberry Pi (multiple models)
- Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
- BeaglePlay
- Arduino boards
- ESP32 development boards

Detailed inventory will be documented in the `hardware-platforms/` submodule.

## Approach

This repository focuses on:

- Accurate, reproducible documentation
- Systematic learning progression
- Practical implementation
- Learning from both successes and failures

## Repository Organization

The repository uses Git submodules to organize different learning domains. Each submodule is an independent repository focused on a specific area.

See [docs/SUBMODULES.md](docs/SUBMODULES.md) for planned submodules.

## Documentation Standards

All work follows consistent templates and standards:

- Standardized templates in `docs/templates/`
- Documentation standards in `docs/standards/`
- Scientific methodology for experiments
- Complete documentation of procedures and results

## Core Principles

1. **Don't Panic**: When things break, analyze methodically
2. **Document Everything**: Future you will thank present you
3. **Reproducibility**: Every procedure should be repeatable
4. **Learn from Failures**: Document what doesn't work and why

## References

See [BIBLIOGRAPHY.md](../BIBLIOGRAPHY.md) for a comprehensive list of references and resources.

## Integration Goal

The DevOps homelab will serve as the integration point, providing:

- Automated build and test infrastructure
- Cross-compilation support
- Container orchestration
- Monitoring and metrics
- Documentation hosting

Detailed plans in the `devops-homelab/` submodule.

## Value Proposition

This repository's value comes from:

- Systematic documentation
- Reproducible procedures
- Learning from failures
- Building interconnected knowledge

## Status

**Date**: November 2025  
**Phase**: Initial Setup

Completed:
- Repository structure
- Documentation standards
- Template creation
- Submodule planning

## Next Steps

1. Create `hardware-platforms` submodule
2. Begin embedded Linux labs
3. Set up initial homelab infrastructure
4. Document first complete system bring-up

## Remember

**Don't Panic. Document Everything. Learn Continuously.**
